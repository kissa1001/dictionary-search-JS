Problem:

“You are given a dictionary (dictionary.txt), containing a list of words, one per line. Imagine you have seven tiles. Each tile is either blank or contains a single lowercase letter (a-z).  Please list all the words from the dictionary that can be produced by using some or all of the seven tiles, in any order. A blank tile is a wildcard, and can be used in place of any letter.  

1. Find all of the words that can be formed if you don't have to deal with blank tiles.  
2. Find all of the words that can be formed, including those where blank tiles are used as wildcards.  
3. Please bear in mind you will need to process several hundred of 7-tile sets with the same dictionary.

How to run the program:

1. Put your tiles set or multiple tiles sets in tiles.txt and save
2. run in terminal "node app.js"
